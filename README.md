# Voice Interface Creation GUI
Welcome to the Voice Interface Creation GUI, a tool designed to empower users to create their personalized voice interface within minutes. Our intuitive GUI enables developers and non-technical users to create voice interfaces effortlessly, with no coding experience required.


### Getting Started
To get started with our tool, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository: ``` git clone https://github.com/your_username/voice-interface-creation-gui.git ```
- Install the following packages using pip:
- ``` graphviz: pip install graphviz ```
- PySoundFile: ``` pip install PySoundFile ```
- torchaudio: ``` pip install torchaudio ```
- Launch the GUI by running the script located at ``` GUI.ipynb ``` file.
- You can also check the class with the ASR and T2S models on the ``` VI.ipynb ```
 
### How it Works
- Our tool uses a simple graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to define and configure screens, modify names as desired, and add various actions corresponding to each screen's functionality. For instance, users can design a Home Assistant Voice Interface with screens such as Lightbulbs, Coffee Machines, and Plugs. Each of these screens can have actions such as Turn On, Turn Off, and Status.

- The Voice Interface can be customized further by adding more screens and actions as needed, allowing for a tailor-made, user-specific experience. This streamlined process simplifies Voice Interface creation and encourages users of all skill levels to engage with the technology.
